# I mean really, who thought this was a good idea?
Okay maybe i'm being a bit over-dramatic.  

Conky is a good idea, the ability to project whatever the fuck you want onto the root desktop for shit like system monitors, etc, great idea!  

And then you start actually manipulating your conkyrc and you realize that there's next to NO documentation besides the fucking *man* page... Which okay maybe i'm being a bit spoiled when it comes to documentation but my **point still stands!**

Either way, I think i've got something that works fairly well, the battery charge won't fucking display. ~~Which is the entire reason I had to fuck with conky in the first place but you know~~

So if I can't get that to work I guess i'll sacrifice some screen space for a polybar setup that isn't total aids. Maybe make it just really small.

But because i'm setting up an openbox config on my laptop I actually have to be able to see shit like CPU temp and Battery info... Oh well
