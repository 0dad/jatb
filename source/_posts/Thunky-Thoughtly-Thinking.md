# Plants

I got some plants today.
Succulents from a friend of a friend and a vine plant cutting from the mother of a friend. 

I have a gut feeling the succulents might not make it, just from how seemingly finnicky succulents are. __I mean the internet told me so it's gotta be true, right?__

I've found myself growing more and more lonely as time goes on, so maybe getting some greenery in my room will dull the edge. 
Fingers crossed!
